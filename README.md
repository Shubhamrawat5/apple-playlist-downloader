## apple-playlist-downloader 🎵

This is a fork of https://github.com/Shubhamrawat5/apple-playlist-downloader.git

This version adds ability to more easily download from the terminal as it uses a command prompt


## Initial setup
1. Open cmd/console
2. Clone repo by `git clone https://github.com/Shubhamrawat5/apple-playlist-downloader.git`
3. Open directory by `cd apple-playlist-downloader`
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
5. Run `node start.js`
6. Enter the URL to an Apple Music playlist or album to start downloading.

---
Note: after initial setup, just run `node start.js` for all future downloads
---

- Now a folder named "songs" will be created.

- Playlist info will be extract and all the matching songs will start donwloading!

- If by chance you stop the script in between, then no worries as if song is already downloaded then next time it won't be downloaded again!

- Also there is 5% chance that song's some remix or different same name song will get downloaded...
